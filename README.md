# ABAQUS-US

This REPO contains a variety of ABAQUS user element (UEL) and user material (UMAT) subroutines. A list of input files and the related subroutine is defined in the file versheet.dat.In the future I will add more details on how to use the subroutines. The subroutines include classical and Cosserat elements with various constitutive models in the form of UMATs.
